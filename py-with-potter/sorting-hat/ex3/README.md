Write your own sorting hat
For the third exercise we will make it simple, well kinda simple....
You will read each file in the data/characters folder and sort each character
into 4 different arrays for each of the houses. Each character will have
which house they belong to which can make it easier to program. Your output 
should be to print the housename with all of the members inside for each house.
hint:
build on your previous program
characterFolder="../../data/characters"
